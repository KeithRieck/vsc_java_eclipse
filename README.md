# VSC Java project using Eclipse classpath files

This is an example of a Java project for Visual Studio Code.
It uses a .classpath file from Eclipse to set up the project classpath.
The advantage of this is that you don't need to install Maven or Gradle or 
anything else beyond the "Java Extension Pack".

## How to create a VSC project for Eclipse

The easiest way to create the eclipse dot-files is to start the project
in Eclipse.  Honestly though, if you have Eclipse, why are you bothering with VSC?

It would also be reasonable to copy this project's structure and modify as needed.
The dot-files are pretty readable.

Also, VSC will create the Eclipse dot-files for Maven projects.  Gradle projects
can generate the files for both Eclipse and IntelliJ.
